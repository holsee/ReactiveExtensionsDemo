Reactive Extensions for .NET Demo Code
========

This is the sample code I am using to give an introduction to the Reactive Extensions library.

This will be ever expanding as my own knowledge on the topic expands.

The aim is to keep it simple by have each mini demonstration self contained in a single method where possible.

This project was created using Visual Studio 2010 & C# 4 & .NET 4 & Reactive Extensions for .NET 4 (which you can download from: [here][2])
